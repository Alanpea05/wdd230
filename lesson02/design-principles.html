        <img class="blocks_img" src="images/innova.jpeg" alt="">
        <p> Visual Hierarchy talks about placing a single thing as a priority 
            without showing too much information about the entire theme of the page,
             but rather emphasizing attention to a single product/information with 
             which the user can interact and use as a reference to access other 
             sites from the web.  
             Innova sports used seasonal products such as the NFL to show an 
             interesting option that will probably lead many users to click on the
              search and navigation buttons.

        <h3>Spotify</h3>
        <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/"> www.spotify.com </a>
        <img class="blocks_img" src="images/spotify.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>  Hick's Law tells us that the options for the user to make a decision 
            must be limited and must focus on the necessary ones, since if too many
             things are offered in a single image, the user will not know what to 
             choose, what they are looking for is a Quick decision making, in this 
             case Spotify used its space very well so that its subscription packages
              are shown one by one, with a total of only 5,the options are 
              being discarded since there are packages that only apply to students or a 
              more familiar number.

        <a href="https://www.airbnb.mx/"> www.airbnb.mx </a>
        <img class="blocks_img"  src="images/airbnb.jpeg" alt="">
        <p> Fitt's law tells us that the distance between the user's fingers and the
             buttons needed to complete an action should be short, so that a very 
             long movement is not necessary to access the main functions, in this
              case airbnb accommodated everything very focused and strategically so
               that the movements are very short and by sections, below it has together the 
               options of favorites, login and find, while above the search engine with the 
               filters and the type of adventure desired.
